---
### Confusing instructions
- The installation of the Make command is indicated; however, it would be more understandable if the OS platforms that this instruction relates to are specified. If the user is not familiar with Make or is running an operating system where Make is not easily accessible, they may encounter difficulties.

### Errors not mentioned in the documentation
- Installation or configuration issues with Docker may occur for users. For typical Docker problems, it would be helpful to include troubleshooting advice or connections to relevant resources.
- When attempting to access the API, users may run into issues if they have other processes open on port 8080. It would be useful to have instructions on how to handle port conflicts.
  
### Getting stuck
- If users are unclear about the function of the.env file or experience permission issues when attempting to create or alter files, they may become stopped at the phase of copying text from.env.example into.env.

### Additional steps not mentioned
- Depending on their particular deployment scenario, users might need to configure extra options in the.env file (e.g., database credentials, API keys). It would be beneficial to provide a template or example.env file with placeholders for these settings.
- No instructions are provided on how to manage or stop the Docker container once it is operating. Providing guidance on the termination of the container would obviate the need for users to look for this information elsewhere.
  
### Suggestions and comments
- Users who face problems during installation would find it easier to use and less frustrating if there included a troubleshooting area with frequent faults and answers.
