Task: Write an instruction on how to test the Ushahidi platform for accessibility
How would you go about testing the Ushahidi platform on the web for accessibility? This is one of the first tasks of the internship so dig into the platform and think about strategies and methods for testing.

This task is open for everyone! Just jump in, no need to get assigned to the issue 
You can document your findings anywhere you want, for example in a blog-post or a gist and then submit the link via this google-form: https://forms.gle/of3VdBNUDwKCDCgr7

### Learn about the criteria and rules for accessibility:
- Comprehend the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These guidelines offer numerous suggestions for improving the accessibility of web content for individuals with impairments.
- Examine the best practices and accessibility criteria that are particular to the front-end frameworks and libraries, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other technologies and frameworks utilized in the Ushahidi platform.
### Utilize automated testing techniques to assess the platform:
- Scan the web pages on the Ushahidi platform with automated accessibility testing tools such as axe, WAVE, or Google Lighthouse to find any possible accessibility problems.
- These tools can check for common accessibility issues with keyboard navigation, alternate text for images, color contrast, and other issues.
- But remember that because automated techniques can't detect every accessibility problem, they should be used in conjunction with manual testing.
### Handle assistive technology testing by hand:
- Use screen readers (such as JAWS, VoiceOver for macOS, or NVDA for Windows) to test the platform and make sure that material is readable and accessible for people who depend on these technologies.
- Navigate the platform's pages, forms, and interactive components using a screen reader to ensure that all information is appropriately presented and that the navigation is clear and easy to use.
- Try varying the combinations of your screen reader and browser to see how they behave and interpret differently.
- Test the platform's keyboard navigation to make sure that all features and content can be accessed and used without the need for a mouse or other pointing devices.
- Try navigating menus and modal dialogs, activating controls, and tab-navigating through interactive sections.
### Examine the contrast between colors and accessibility:
- Examine the platform's color schemes to make sure there is enough contrast between the text and the background while adhering to WCAG requirements.
- Check for functional focus indicators, understandable labeling and instructions, and text resizing capabilities that don't interfere with the layout.
- Test the platform on many web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and browser versions to guarantee consistent accessibility across rendering engines. You should also test the platform on different device setups.
- Make that the platform is responsive and usable across a range of viewports by testing it on a variety of gadgets and screen sizes, such as laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and desktop computers.
### Include people with disabilities in the evaluation procedure:
- Work together, if you can, with people who have various disabilities (visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor) to obtain direct input on how accessible the platform is.
- Take note of their interactions with the platform and collect their feedback and ideas for enhancements.
- Create a methodical procedure for recording and reporting accessibility problems discovered during testing. Document and report accessibility issues.
- Sort concerns into priority lists according to their importance and severity, then collaborate with the development team to find solutions.
### Constant observation and testing:
- Conduct frequent testing when new features or platform updates are released, and incorporate accessibility testing into the development process.
- Keep an eye out for any new accessibility problems or regressions on the platform that might result from modifications to the codebase or external dependencies.
