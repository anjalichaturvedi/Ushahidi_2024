Evaluation:
Why did you choose this particular tool? 
Pa11y is a flexible accessibility testing tool that offers a wide range of customisation possibilities. It is appropriate for our heterogeneous codebase because it supports several standards and guidelines.

How does you like it?
Pa11y is an intuitive tool that offers thorough reports on accessibility that highlight problems and offer solutions.

Does the output make sense to you?
Yes, the results are easily interpreted and have a clear framework. It contains lists of HTML components that are affected, descriptions of accessibility problems, and recommendations for fixing them.

Was the implementation process simple or very complex?: Pa11y was easy to implement. I incorporated it into our codebase by following the installation instructions in the documentation, and I had no trouble at all.

Do you “trust” the output or do you think it misses something?: I believe the output of Pa11y for identifying common accessibility issues. Like any automated tool, though, it might overlook some subtle problems that need for manual inspection or assistive technology testing.

Any other comments or insights you would like to share: Pa11y is a useful tool that we may include in our accessibility testing arsenal. We are able to adapt the testing procedure to our own demands and specifications because to its adaptability and customization possibilities. Furthermore, incorporating automated accessibility testing throughout our process of development guarantees that our codebase remains accessible and inclusive for all users.
