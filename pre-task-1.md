---
### Overview
- Ushahidi is a non-profit technology company that aims to empower marginalized communities by facilitating the collection, visualization, and analysis of data.
- Platform serves as an open-source tool for crowdsourcing data which enables citizens to report incidents and events: used to analyze for trends and patterns.
  
### WhatsApp Integration Rationale
- Due to WhatsApp's widespread availability and ease of use, integrating WhatsApp expands citizen reporting
WhatsApp can significantly broaden the reach of the Ushahidi platform to local communities, amplifying marginalized voices during critical situations.
- Backend Framework: Django
- Django is recommended over Flask because of its features, scalability, and ecosystem.
- Django's includes an ORM, admin interface, and authentication system
- For the existing PHP/Laravel backend, we could integrate the WhatsApp API functionality within the existing codebase to maintain consistency and avoid managing multiple project backends.

### WhatsApp Business API Integration
- Infobip is the preferred choice for integrating the WhatsApp Business API (Reasons: detailed documentation, feature set, global reach, and reliability)
- Libraries also include seamless interaction with the WhatsApp Business API making it a smoother process overall
Django can handle database interactions efficiently. For Flask, SQLAlchemy can be used for database management
For parsing JSON content received from the WhatsApp API, Python's built-in 'json' module and the 'parse' library can be used.

### User Experience (UX) and Design
- For better UX, user-friendly and intuitive experience should be provided: adding, removing, and configuring WhatsApp channels
- Break down the interface into components that can be easily rearranged based on user needs (better scalability)
Dedicate sections for viewing incoming messages and moderating content from WhatsApp (better usability and efficiency)

### Authorization and Security
- To ensure only authorized users can access and manage WhatsApp data sources, role-based access control can be used
- OAuth2 to verify user identities and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Also, consider implementing two-factor authentication for added security

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- Cypress testing framework can be used to ensure the working and reliability of components handling WhatsApp Business API interactions.
- Add comprehensive test cases for unit and end-to-end testing

### State Management
- If the frontend is developed using React, the Redux library can be used for state management
- If Angular is used, RxJS for reactive programming and NgRx for managing application state in Angular applications can be used.
